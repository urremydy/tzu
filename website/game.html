                Retro gaming consoles like the NES, Sega Genesis, and Atari 2600 introduced millions to the world of video games.

            <h3>Why Retro Games Still Matter</h3>
            <p>
                Retro games arenâ€™t just a blast from the past; they represent the foundation of the gaming industry. Titles like 
                *Pac-Man*, *The Legend of Zelda*, and *Space Invaders* introduced revolutionary concepts in design and storytelling.

            <h3>The Evolution of Pixel Art in Gaming</h3>
            <p>
                Pixel art was born out of necessity during the early days of gaming, but it has since become a celebrated art form. 
                Modern developers often revisit this style to evoke nostalgia while combining it with new-age game mechanics and 
                storytelling. Titles like *Shovel Knight* and *Celeste* prove that pixel art is timeless and continues to inspire 
                generations of gamers and creators.
